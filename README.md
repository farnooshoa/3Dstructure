Protein Structure Analysis using PDB Files

Overview

This project extracts and visualizes protein structure information from PDB (Protein Data Bank) files using Biopython, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It processes atomic coordinate data, performs basic analysis, and generates a 3D scatter plot representation of the protein structure.

Features

Extracts structural information from PDB files (chains, residues, and atomic coordinates)

Processes data into a structured Pandas DataFrame

Visualizes protein structures in 3D using Matplotlib

Saves processed data to a CSV file for further analysis
